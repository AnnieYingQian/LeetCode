Problem:
Given a string s,
find the longest palindromic substring in s.
You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Thoughts:
How to define palindromic?
aba
abba

Two Pointers
even: len1
a b b a c
odd:  len2
a b a c d

find mid point 
max = Math.max(len1, len2)
even: end = 3 len1 = 4
start = end - len1/2 = 3 -
odd:  start = end - len2/2 + 1
