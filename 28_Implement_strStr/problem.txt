Original Problem:
Implement strStr().
Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack,
or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string?
This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem,
we will return 0 when needle is an empty string.
This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Repeat Problem:
1. string haystack
   string needle
2. index of first occurrence of needle index
3. no part => null

Solution:
traverse
0 1 2 3
h e l l
0 1
l l
length of needle = 2
i 0 h
j 0 l
i 1 e
j 0 l
i 2 l
j 1 l
i 3 l
j 2 == length
i 4 o
index = 4 - 2 = 2
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
h e l r l r o
0 1 2
l r o
i 0 h
j 0 l
i 1 e
j 0 l
i 2 l
j 1 r
i 3 r
j 2 o
i 4 l
l != o, 4 - 2 + 1
Time Complexity: O(m * n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
