Problem:
Given a string s,
find the longest palindromic substring in s.
You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Thoughts:
Brute force:
  Input: babaddc
  bab -> 3
  babaddc
  aba -> 3 no need to replace
  babaddc
  baddc
  addc
  dd -> 2 no need to replace
  ddc
  dc
  c
  Output: bab
  Time complexity: O(n^2)
  Space complexity: O(n)
